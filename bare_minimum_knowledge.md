This page outlines and describes various topics a cybersecurity candidate should know.   

Obtaining one or more of the recommended certifications may provide a base level of knowledge, but there are many other things that you should research and become familiar with. There may be 1,000,000 empty cyber jobs available today, but only a small portion of those are entry-level positions, and there are thousands of other entry-level candidates trying to break into the cybersecurity industry.   

To separate yourself from that large group of candidates and stand out, you must have a broader and more refined level of knowledge in the relevant area you are trying to apply.  This commonly requires a bit of self-studying and research. Build a home lab and practice various security concepts.  You may not be able to play with enterprise-class tools yet, but if you learn the underlying principles of how they work, then the tool's name won't matter, and you can easily change tools fairly quickly because you understand the concepts.

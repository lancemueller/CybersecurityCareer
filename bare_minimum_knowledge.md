This page outlines and describes various topics a cybersecurity candidate should know.   

Obtaining one or more of the recommended certifications may provide a base level of knowledge, but there are many other things that you should research and become familiar with. There may be 1,000,000 empty cyber jobs available today, but only a small portion of those are entry-level positions, and there are thousands of other entry-level candidates trying to break into the cybersecurity industry.   

To separate yourself from that large group of candidates and stand out, you must have a broader and more refined level of knowledge in the relevant area you are trying to apply.

This page outlines and describes various topics a cybersecurity candidate should know when applying for any entry-level cybersecurity job.   

Obtaining one or more of the recommended certifications may provide a base level of knowledge, but there are many other things that you should research and become familiar with. There may be 1,000,000 empty cyber jobs available today, but only a small portion of those are entry-level positions, and there are thousands of other entry-level candidates trying to break into the cybersecurity industry.   

To separate yourself from that large group of candidates and stand out, you must have a broader and more refined level of knowledge in the relevant area you are trying to apply.  This commonly requires a bit of self-studying and research. Build a home lab and practice various security concepts.  You may not be able to play with enterprise-class tools yet, but if you learn the underlying principles of how they work, then the tool's name won't matter, and you can easily change tools fairly quickly because you understand the concepts.   

For example, you will only have access to commercial vulnerability scanning tools once you get a job in that role. However, by learning the concepts at home through free tools like Nessus or OpenVAS, you will learn most of the core principles used by those enterprise tools. You only need to learn their GUI or way of doing it.   

### General Knowledge  
This section applies to knowledge you should know and feel comfortable with for almost all cybersecurity roles or positions.   

+ **Collaboration Tools** - You shoul dbe very familiar and comfortable with the use of common enterprise collaboration tools such as the Google or Microsoft suite of tools. OneDrive, SharePoint, cloud sharing, etc., are commonly used.

+ **Social Engineering Concepts** - Since social engineering is the biggest threat to organizations, you should understand the common social engineering tactics used by threat actors and how they work at a high level.
+ **Industry Security Frameworks** - At a high level, you should be familiar with the various security frameworks commonly used in organizations. You don't need to memorize each section but should be familiar with them.
+ **Virtualization** - You should be comfortable installing, configuring, and using a type II hypervisor to virtualize various operating systems. Virtualization is a very common technique for testing and learning various topics.
+ **Linux Operating System** - You don't need to be an expert, but you should be familiar with how to install, configure, and use a Linux operating system. Due to their open-source and free-licensing nature, Linux operating systems are very common in enterprise environments and commonly used for virtualization and testing.

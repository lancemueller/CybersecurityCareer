You are strongly encouraged to start searching for and reviewing job postings well before you may be ready to actually apply. This services several important purposes, to include refining the keywords you use and to become familiar with the typical requirements being asked for in the job posting.  

### Job Searching Engines
There are several job searching engines, I recommend setting up real-time alerts using LinkedIn and Indeed, at the minimum. 

### Keywords
Play around with various keywords to consistently identify job postings in the role you are interested in. Set the location in all of United States at first to identify more postings and refine you search. You can also review those posting outside of the area you may be interested in to learn what requirements or skills are being listed.

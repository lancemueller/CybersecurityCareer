You are strongly encouraged to start searching for and reviewing job postings well before you may be ready to apply. This serves several important purposes, including refining the keywords you use and becoming familiar with the typical requirements asked for in the job posting.  

### Job Searching Engines
There are several job search engines. I recommend setting up real-time alerts using LinkedIn and Indeed at the minimum. 

### Keywords
Play around with various keywords to consistently identify job postings in the role you are interested in. Set the location in all of the United States first to identify more postings and refine your search. You can also look at those postings outside of the area you may be interested in to learn what requirements or skills are listed. Once you find good keywords, narrow your search to the areas you are interested in. 

### Job Posting Requirements
Hiring managers want high-performing team members who don't need a lot of time and effort to train and build skills. It is common for hiring managers to set the bar very high in the job posting. Don't let this discourage you. Apply anyway. The worst that can happen is they ignore or reject your application. 

### Resume
When applying for a job, review the job posting and ensure your resume meets (and mentions) the main requirements. Even if you don't have the required experience, highlight what you do have in that area and what you can do to increase those skills. It is not uncommon to have a few variations or versions of a resume depending on the different types of roles you may be looking to apply for.  For example, I would have a version for security operations and a different version for penetration testing. Each highlights the different skills and areas of knowledge. If you use one, sometimes the area of knowledge gets generalized and watered down and doesn't stand out as much as if you build a resume for a specific role.

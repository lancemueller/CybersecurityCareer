## A list of resources for those looking to begin their career or advance in cybersecurity:

For those looking to enter cybersecurity, I strongly recommend getting at least an initial certification to help you get noticed during the application process. All of these certifications cost $250-$500, depending on sales and other discounts, but they are well worth it, and they last three years before they have to be renewed.   

#### Recommended certs for beginners:  Security+, Network+, Cloud+ (CompTIA), 

The rest of the listed resources are free unless noted otherwise:

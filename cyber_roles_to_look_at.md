There is a wide range of cybersecurity roles and jobs. Each organization may name or title them slightly differently. Some roles are more common as an entry point for people just starting in cybersecurity, while others can require a deep understanding of a topic and applied expertise. The list below is not all-inclusive but lists some of the most common roles and titles you would likely encounter in a small to large organization. The color represents the levels where more experience may be required or is a common entry-level role.

#### Green = Entry level   
It often requires little to no previous experience but certainly requires a good understanding of security principles.    

#### Yellow = Demonstrated past work experience   
This often requires some prior experience in this role to establish higher expertise.    

#### Pink = Senior-level roles    
Requires tenure and demonstrated knowledge and understanding. Can make decisions based on experience, not simply from a textbook.   

#### Red = Expert-level rolesâ€”Subject matter experts.   
These roles require a deep understanding of technical capabilities that can be easily demonstrated beyond what a book or framework describes. They often use intuition and knowledge based on repeated past experiences.

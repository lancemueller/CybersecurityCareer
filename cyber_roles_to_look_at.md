There is a wide range of cybersecurity roles and jobs. Each organization may name or title them slightly differently. Some roles are more common as an entry point for people just starting in cybersecurity, while others can require a deep understanding of a topic and applied expertise. The list below is not all-inclusive but lists some of the most common roles and titles you would likely encounter in a small to large organization. The color represents the levels where more experience may be required or is a common entry-level role.

There is a wide range of cybersecurity roles and jobs. Each organization may name or title them slightly differently. Some roles are more common as an entry point for people just starting in cybersecurity, while others can require a deep understanding of a topic and applied expertise. The table below is not an all-inclusive list of roles but identifies some of the most common roles and titles you would likely encounter in a small to large organization. The color represents the levels where more experience may be required or is a common entry-level role.

Using an example of someone learning about ropes as part of their job, here is what the different roles and titles may look like:
|Entry Level|Career|Senior|Expert|
|:---------:|:----:|:----:|:----:|
|Learns about ropes/can tie basic knots and is shown complex knots but needs oversight and verification by others| Calculates rope strength and knows most, if not all, different types of knots| Understands how ropes are made| Knows more about ropes than you ever will|  

Now applying it to cybersecurity jobs:

#### Green = Entry level   
It often requires little to no previous experience but certainly requires a good understanding of security principles.  The manager is expecting to do some on-the-job training and development.  There will likely be gaps in knowledge, but time on the job will help fill those gaps. In Security Operations (SOC), these are often called Tier 1 level analysts.     

#### Yellow = Demonstrated past work experience   
This often requires some prior experience in this role to establish higher expertise. This means it can be in a different role or industry. For example, a person applying for cyber threat intelligence may have experience in a past military role related to threat intelligence, which can be more easily transferable into this new role.   This is typically someone exposed to various topics, tools, and scenarios and has experience using the relevant tools. Often referred to as Tier 2 analysts.

#### Pink = Senior-level roles    
Requires tenure and demonstrated knowledge and understanding. Can make decisions based on experience, not simply from a textbook. Depending on the organization, they can be called Tier 3 analysts.    

#### Red = Expert-level roles    
Subject matter experts. These roles require a deep understanding of technical capabilities that can be easily demonstrated beyond what a book or framework describes. They often use intuition and knowledge based on repeated past experiences.  Depending on the organization, they can be called Tier 3 analysts.
